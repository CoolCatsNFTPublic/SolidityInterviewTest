### ERC1155SupplyCC

Why was this file used and not used directly from the OpenZepplin library?

Solution - This file is used to extend the ERC1155 smart contract with functionality
used to determine the total supply of a token id. This is useful where a mix of 
NFTs and Fungible tokens are to be created using the ERC1155 smart contract. While a totalSupply of 1 might mean the 
corresponding is an NFT, there is no guarantees that no other token with the
same id are not going to be minted.

### Claim()

Please adjust the claim function so that an address can only claim once per day.

Solution - resolved within smart contract code
